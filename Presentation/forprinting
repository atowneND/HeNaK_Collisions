1.
- I'm going to talk about physical interpretations of theoretical analysis of rotationally inelastic
  collisions

2.
- molecule can vibrate and rotate
- upon collision with an atom, quantum numbers can change
- vibrational and rotational states that can change in collision

3.
- electronic state -> potential curves
- energy as a function of internuclear separation or bond length

4.
- our choice of potential curve specifies the energy at which the collisions in question take place

5.
- experiment can measure information about the cross sections, which are a metric of the likelihood
  of transitions, averaged over the quantum number m
- fraction of orientation that is preserved, which is related to quantum number m
- orientation is the extent to which all angular momenta point in the same direction
    - cell environment, angular momenta point in all directions
    - collision is a randomizing process
- preserved orientation is a measure of how randomizing the collisions are

6.
- the orientation is related to the geometric relationship between m and j
- j precesses about the z axis
- m, j, theta
- expectation value

7.
- ground potential curve
- A potential curve: where the studied collisions happen
- pump laser is left circularly polarized, populates vibrational and rotational states in A
- after collision, probe laser: swept across a range of frequencies to measure the final orientation

8.
- polarized light has selection rules for transitions
- pump laser always pumps so delta m = plus one
- each row's potential curve
- nonzero <m> prior to collisions
- linear probe laser measures the orientation

9.
- results of experiment and initial theory
- propensity for even delta j
- cannot say it is approximately homonuclear because propensity depends on collision partner
- theory has large computational requirements and K is too large with current methods
- theory and experiment agree

10.
- huge calculations to get B_lambdas - probability for transferring an amount of angular momentum
- want a physical interpretation - my job this summer
- vector model definition of lambda - metric of the discrete value of angular momentum transfered in
  the collision
- alpha, discrete nature
- take the qm theory a step further to get a more intuitive physical interpretation:
    - make alpha continuous for semiclassical approximations

11.
- law of cosines, relate lambda and alpha
    - tipping angle
- instead of summing over lambda, integrate over alpha
- alpha is the tipping angle (remember the vector model)
- B is the distribution of tipping angles

12.
- theoretical B lambda and B alpha (difference between discrete and continuous)
- Plotting B vs the tipping angle shows which alphas are most likely
- biggest B's are near small alpha

13.
- helium and argon display similar overall behaviors
- small tipping angles
- argon is bigger

14.
- He propensity, not for Ar
    - experimental propensity for helium is much stronger than for argon, which could also account
  for not seeing it
    - newer potential curves may change this for argon
- when expectation value of alpha is big the transitions are less likely
- bigger j's meant less tipping

15.
- sum over lambda, integrate over alpha and look at the cross sectional distribution over delta
  theta
- back to the vector model: delta theta is not alpha
- unless j, j' are coplanar with each other and the z axis, as seen in picture
- give example where delta theta is zero - CONTRAST WITH PIC

16.
- for a particular alpha, j' can be anywhere on the circle in the picture but will tend to rest
  where theta = theta prime
- even if delta theta is zero, j will not necessarily point in the same direction as j prime (in
  fact this is quite rare)
- QM
    - average delta theta over all possible m/m' transitions
    - histogram binned by delta thetas and convolved with a gaussian - essentially smoothing the
  discrete values into a distribution to compare with the semiclassical model
- SC
    - model that relates delta theta to alpha
    - considered all azimuthal phi, given an initial theta, found distribution of theta prime
    - averaging over continuous distribution of tipping angles
    - *integral over the values of alpha allowed by geometry in form for Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature
  of the first kind
    - *range of integration is cos(theta+theta') < cos(alpha) < cos(theta-theta')
    - y = (cos(alpha)-cos(theta)cos(theta'))/(sin(theta)sin(theta'))

17.
- theta to theta prime distribution centers around delta theta = 0
- semiclassical 

18-20.
- SC and QM agree really well at large j values
- spike near small delta theta
- delta theta is rarely exactly zero
- SC tends not to work as well at smaller j values

21.
- m to m prime distribution centers around delta m != 0
- as expected
- *quantum mechanical, no smoothing

22.
- theta tends to be conserved, which is consistent with other research in this field
- m tends to change in such a way that delta theta is small
- vector model and semiclassical model give good physical interpretations of the jm->j'm'
  transitions
