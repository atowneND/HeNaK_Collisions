Experimental procedure
In order to choose a nonzero orientation for the initial state of the system,
the experimental group excites the system from the ground state to a higher
potential, the A state.  A pump laser that is left circularly polarized
populates the A state's vibrational and rotational states in such a way that
there is a preferential population of large m due to the selection rule imposed
by the laser's polarization.  After the collisions, the probe laser is swept
across a range of frequencies to measure the orientation.

The probe laser is linearly polarized; linear polarization can be expressed as
a superposition of left and right circularly polarized light.  Because of the
initial nonzero orientation of the system, the different circular polarizations
interact with the system differentially.  After interacting with the sample,
the superposition of light that was not absorbed is passed through a linear
polarizer perpendicular to the intial polarization.  If the laser is unchanged,
no signal will pass through the polarizer.  However, because the left and right
circular polarizations were absorbed differently, the superposition after
interacting with the system is no longer perfectly linear but rather
elliptically polarized.  Therefore, whatever signal is detected after the
polarizer is a metric of the final orientation.

Previous results
Experiment and theory tend to agree in their determinations of the rate
constants.  For helium, past work has shown that there is a propensity for the
change in j to be an even number.

It was originally thought that this propensity was related to the strict
selection rule for homonuclear diatomic molecules where no odd delta j
transitions are allowed.  Sodium and potassium are in the same column of the
periodic table, so it was thought that perhaps NaK was approximately
homonuclear, which would explain the propensity.  However, it has been
demonstrated that the propensity for an even delta j depends on the collision
partner, where as behavior of an approximately homonuclear molecule should
depend solely on the molecule.  Some initial experimental results for certain
states in a collision with potassium show no propensity for even delta j at
all.  Unfortunately, theory has large computational requirements, and it is too
computationally expensive to model NaK + K to confirm.

Some mechanism other than approximate homonuclear behavior is affecting the
delta j propensity, so theory and experiment are still investigating and
getting good agreement.

Goal of this project: physical interpretation
The large calculations for the theoretical analysis are used to calculate
B-lambda values.  These values are the discrete probabilities for transferring
a specific amount of angular momentum to the NaK molecule in the transition.
These calculations were done prior to the beginning of the summer.

The goal of this summer's project was to gain a deeper physical understanding
of this angular momentum transition.  Using the vector model facilitated
understanding the relationship between j, j', lambda, and alpha.  The vector
model definition of lambda is a metric of the discrete value of angular
momentum transferred in the collision, or the distance between the tip of the j
vector and the tip of the j' vector.  There are a finite number of discrete
lambda values for a given j->j' transition.  Alpha is the angle between j and
j' and is likewise discrete.

QM analysis
These discrete values 
\newline take the qm theory a step further to get a more intuitive physical
  interpretation:
    * make alpha continuous for semiclassical approximations

SC analysis
\newline law of cosines, relate lambda and alpha
    * tipping angle
\newline instead of summing over lambda, integrate over alpha
\newline alpha is the tipping angle (remember the vector model)
\newline B is the distribution of tipping angles

Results of B analysis
\newline theoretical B lambda and B alpha (difference between discrete and continuous)
\newline Plotting B vs the tipping angle shows which alphas are most likely
\newline biggest B's are near small alpha

\newline helium and argon display similar overall behaviors
\newline small tipping angles
\newline argon is bigger

Conclusions of B analysis
\newline He propensity, not for Ar
    * experimental propensity for helium is much stronger than for argon, which
      could also account for not seeing it
    * newer potential curves may change this for argon
\newline when expectation value of alpha is big the transitions are less likely
\newline bigger j's meant less tipping

Cross section vs delta-theta analysis: vector model
\newline sum over lambda, integrate over alpha and look at the cross sectional
  distribution over delta theta
\newline back to the vector model: delta theta is not alpha
\newline unless j, j' are coplanar with each other and the z axis, as seen in picture
\newline give example where delta theta is zero: CONTRAST WITH PIC

\newline for a particular alpha, j' can be anywhere on the circle in the picture but
  will tend to rest where theta = theta prime
\newline even if delta theta is zero, j will not necessarily point in the same
  direction as j prime (in fact this is quite rare)
  
Cross section vs delta-theta analysis: QM
\newline average delta theta over all possible m/m' transitions
\newline histogram binned by delta thetas and convolved with a gaussian: essentially smoothing the discrete values into a distribution to compare with the semiclassical model

Cross section vs delta-theta analysis: SC
\newline model that relates delta theta to alpha
\newline considered all azimuthal phi, given an initial theta, found distribution
  of theta prime
\newline averaging over continuous distribution of tipping angles
\newline *integral over the values of alpha allowed by geometry in form for
  Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature of the first kind
\newline *range of integration is cos (theta+theta') < cos (alpha) <
  cos (theta-theta')
\begin{equation}
    y={(\cos(\alpha)-\cos(\theta)\cos(\theta'))}\over{\sin(\theta)\sin(\theta')}
\end{equation}

Theta-theta' distribution
\newline theta to theta prime distribution centers around delta theta = 0
\newline semiclassical 

Delta-theta distribution
\newline SC and QM agree really well at large j values
\newline spike near small delta theta
\newline delta theta is rarely exactly zero
\newline SC tends not to work as well at smaller j values

Delta-m distribution
\newline m to m prime distribution centers around delta m =/= 0
\newline as expected
\newline *quantum mechanical, no smoothing

Conclusions
\newline theta tends to be conserved, which is consistent with other research in this
  field
\newline m tends to change in such a way that delta theta is small
\newline vector model and semiclassical model give good physical interpretations of the
  jm->j'm' transitions
