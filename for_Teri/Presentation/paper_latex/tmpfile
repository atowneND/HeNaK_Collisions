Delta-m distribution
-m to m prime distribution centers around delta m =/= 0
-as expected
-*quantum mechanical, no smoothing

Conclusions
-theta tends to be conserved, which is consistent with other research in this
  field
-m tends to change in such a way that delta theta is small
-vector model and semiclassical model give good physical interpretations of the
  jm->j'm' transitions
