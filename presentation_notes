1.
- name, theory, rotationally inelastic collisions

2.
- vibrational and rotational states that can change in collision
- interested in comparing theory and experiment for collisions where momentum
  changes but vibrational state is constant

3.
- electronic state -> potential curves
- experiment and theory choose a subset of these curves to isolate a specific
  energy

4.
- experiment can measure cross sections, which are a metric of the likelihood
  of interaction, averaged over the quantum number m
- fraction of orientation is related to m
- cell environment is random

5.
- the orientation is a relationship between ma nd j
- m, j, theta
- j precesses about the z axis
- expectation value

6.
- lab's lasers must alter the system
- ground to A: specific energy
- after collision, probe laser is linearly polarized
- before detector, linear laser goes through perpendicular polarizer
- signal's presence depends on linear = left + right

7.
- pump laser has a selection rule
- nonzero <m> prior to collisions
- linear laser -> left and right polarizations will interact differently
- final polarization is elliptical and a measure of the final orientation

8.
- results of experiment and initial theory
- propensity for delta j
- homonuclear vs heteronuclear
- experimental potassium negates quasi-homonuclear argument

9.
- theory of calculating cross sections
- vector model definition of lambda - metric of the discrete value of angular
  momentum transfered in the collision
- alpha, discrete nature
- remove the quantum mechanical restrictions and make alpha continuous for
  semiclassical approximations

10.
- law of cosines
- instead of summing over lambda, integrate over alpha
- alpha is the tipping angle (remember the vector model)
- integral looks like a distribution equation - because it is

11.
- results: B vs tipping angle
- biggest B's are near small alpha

12.
- helium and argon display similar overall behaviors

13.
- He propensity
- alpha tends to be small, and when it is big the transitions are less likely
- Ar had no even/odd propensity
- newer potential surfaces may change this
- expectation value of alpha
- argon is bigger
- bigger j's meant less tipping

14.
- sum over lambda, integrate over alpha and look at the cross sections
- back to the vector model: delta theta is not alpha
- unless j, j' are coplanar with each other and the z axis, which doesn't
  happen often because they can precess about the z axis

15.
- for a particular alpha, j' can be anywhere on the circle in the picture
- distribution of delta theta
- 2 models
    - quantum data into a histogram binned by delta thetas and convolved with a
      gaussian - essentially smoothing the delta functions into a distribution

24.
- delta theta tends to be small, which is consistent with other research in
  this field
- delta theta is rarely exactly zero
- larger j transitions have more spread out distributions
- delta j = 1, argon and helium swap at larger delta j's
- jbar trend - SC tends not to work as well at small j's
