1.
- name, theory, rotationally inelastic collisions

2.
- vibrational and rotational states that can change in collision
- we choose the energy of the interactions that we want to study by our choice
  of potential curve

3.
- electronic state -> potential curves
- our choice of potential curve specifies the energy at which the collisions
  in question take place

4.
- experiment can measure cross sections, which are a metric of the likelihood
  of interaction, averaged over the quantum number m
- fraction of orientation is related to m
- cell environment is random

5.
- the orientation is related to the geometric relationship between m and j
- j precesses about the z axis
- m, j, theta
- expectation value

6.
- lab's lasers polarization must be chosen carefully to properly alter the
  system
- ground to A: chosen energy
- pump laser is right circularly polarized
- after collision, probe laser is linearly polarized
- before detector, linear probe laser goes through perpendicular polarizer
- signal's presence depends on linear = left + right

7.
- right circular polarization of pump laser leads to selection rule
- nonzero <m> prior to collisions
- linear probe laser -> left and right polarizations will interact differently
- final polarization is elliptical
- any signal is a measure of the final orientation

8.
- results of experiment and initial theory
- propensity for delta j
- homonuclear vs heteronuclear
- therefore something else is going on
- theory and experiment agree

9.
- theory of calculating cross sections
- vector model definition of lambda - metric of the discrete value of angular
  momentum transfered in the collision
- alpha, discrete nature
- remove the quantum mechanical restrictions and make alpha continuous for
  semiclassical approximations

10.
- law of cosines, relate lambda and alpha, which we call the tipping angle
- instead of summing over lambda, integrate over alpha
- alpha is the tipping angle (remember the vector model)
- B is the distribution of tipping angles

11.
- Plotting B vs the tipping angle shows which alphas are most likely
- biggest B's are near small alpha

12.
- helium and argon display similar overall behaviors
- small tipping angles
- argon is bigger

13.
- He propensity, not for Ar
- newer potential surfaces may change this for argon
- when expectation value of alpha is big the transitions are less likely
- bigger j's meant less tipping

14.
- sum over lambda, integrate over alpha and look at the cross sectional
  distribution over delta theta
- back to the vector model: delta theta is not alpha
- unless j, j' are coplanar with each other and the z axis, which doesn't
  happen often because they can precess

15.
- for a particular alpha, j' can be anywhere on the circle in the picture
- distribution of delta theta
- 2 models
    - quantum data into a histogram binned by delta thetas and convolved with a
      gaussian - essentially smoothing the discrete values into a distribution
      to compare with the semiclassical model
    - semiclassical model

16-17.
- graphing the results show us that...
    - spike near small delta theta
    - delta theta is rarely exactly zero

18-19.
- semiclassical works better at larger j values

20.
- theta tends to be conserved, which is consistent with other research in
  this field
- larger delta j's have more spread out distributions
- delta j = 1, argon and helium swap at larger delta j's
