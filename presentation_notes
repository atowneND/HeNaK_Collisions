1.
- I'm going to talk about physical interpretations of theoretical analysis of
  rotationally inelastic collisions

2.
- molecule can vibrate and rotate
- upon collision with an atom, quantum numbers can change
- vibrational and rotational states that can change in collision

3.
- electronic state -> potential curves
- energy as a function of internuclear separation or bond length

4.
- our choice of potential curve specifies the energy at which the collisions
  in question take place

5.
- experiment can measure cross sections, which are a metric of the likelihood
  of interaction, averaged over the quantum number m
- fraction of orientation that is preserved, which is related to quantum number m
- orientation is the extent to which all angular momenta point in the same
  direction
    - cell environment, angular momenta point in all directions
    - collision is a randomizing process
- preserved orientation is a measure of how randomizing the collisions are

6.
- the orientation is related to the geometric relationship between m and j
- j precesses about the z axis
- m, j, theta
- expectation value

7.
- ground potential curve
- A potential curve: where the studied collisions happen
- pump laser is right circularly polarized, populates vibrational and
  rotational states in A
- after collision, probe laser: swept across a range of frequencies to measure
  the final orientation

8.
- polarized light has selection rules for transitions
- pump laser always pumps so delta m = plus one
- each row's potential curve
- nonzero <m> prior to collisions
- linear probe laser measures the orientation

9.
- results of experiment and initial theory
- propensity for even delta j
- cannot say it is approximately homonuclear because propensity depends on
  collision partner
- experiment and potassium
- theory has large computational requirements and K is too large with current
  methods
- theory and experiment agree

10.
- huge calculations to get B_lambdas - probability for transferring an amount
  of angular momentum
- want a physical interpretation
- vector model definition of lambda - metric of the discrete value of angular
  momentum transfered in the collision
- alpha, discrete nature
- take the qm theory a step further to get a more intuitive physical
  interpretation:
    - remove the quantum mechanical restrictions and make alpha continuous for
      semiclassical approximations

11.
- law of cosines, relate lambda and alpha
    - tipping angle
- instead of summing over lambda, integrate over alpha
- alpha is the tipping angle (remember the vector model)
- B is the distribution of tipping angles

12.
- B lambda and B alpha (difference between discrete and continuous)
- Plotting B vs the tipping angle shows which alphas are most likely
- biggest B's are near small alpha

13.
- helium and argon display similar overall behaviors
- small tipping angles
- argon is bigger

14.
- He propensity, not for Ar
- newer potential curves may change this for argon
- when expectation value of alpha is big the transitions are less likely
- bigger j's meant less tipping

15.
- sum over lambda, integrate over alpha and look at the cross sectional
  distribution over delta theta
- back to the vector model: delta theta is not alpha
- unless j, j' are coplanar with each other and the z axis, which doesn't
  happen often because they can precess
- give example where delta theta is zero

16.
- for a particular alpha, j' can be anywhere on the circle in the picture but
  will tend to rest where theta = theta prime
- even if delta theta is zero, j will not necessarily point in the same
  direction as j prime (in fact this is quite rare)
- QM
    - average delta theta over all possible m/m' transitions
    - histogram binned by delta thetas and convolved with a
      gaussian - essentially smoothing the discrete values into a distribution
      to compare with the semiclassical model
- SC
    - model that relates delta theta to alpha
    - considered all azimuthal phi, given an initial theta, found distribution
      of theta prime
    - averaging over continuous distribution of tipping angles
- relate delta theta to tipping angle

17-19.
- SC and QM agree really well at large j values
- spike near small delta theta
- delta theta is rarely exactly zero
- SC tends not to work as well at smaller j values

20.
- theta tends to be conserved, which is consistent with other research in
  this field
- larger delta j's have more spread out distributions
- delta j = 1, argon and helium swap at larger delta j's

21.
- m to m prime
