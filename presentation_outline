Background
- experimental work (talk to Cara)
- propensity for dj = even
Experimental capabilities
- transitions: probe/pump laser apparatus
- measure change in orientation using polarization
    - if they're just in a cell, molecular orientation will be random, but
      polarized lasers result in rotationally excited states
    - angular momenta point in a direction, so persistent orientation is
      measured, showing jm->j'm'
Theoretical model
- calculations based on potential surface for HeNaK/ArNaK
- focused on lower j values due to computational constraints
- vector model
    - distribution of angles
    - 2 parameters, not 3
Results from data analysis
- tipping angle results (plot and explanations)
- patterns in m across j - theta is sort of conserved
